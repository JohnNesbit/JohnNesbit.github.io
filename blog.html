It is strange that the exhibit that caught my eye was the one I ought relate to least. There was a painful torsion in the bodies laid out before me. The circle of mangled steel around me spun, and I saw the motion of cavalry trampling children, the pleading mothers, and the fighting men. As I spun further, I saw those same mothers and fathers with sickles at the throats of fleeing crowds. The loop of devastation had no end, and the compassion of the story was rewarded only with blood.
      </p>
      <p>
I circled back toward the entrance. A composition of frames of life, music, and tradition laid behind a wall of shattered glass. Blood drooled out of bullet holes in every photo. In another layer, more photos, more sheet music was mâchéd with blood over some of the holes.

A Ziggurat, growing out of the canvas with its red clay bricks, loomed over me. Chains of slavery hung from the pinnacle of the structure, caked red.

      <h2>Let’s Dance</h2>

My world has been swirling lately. There is no one reason, no one question, no one confusion, but rather, an excited malaise, a feeling that sense has abandoned the world, and action alone has taken over.
      </p>
      <p>
So, we dance. We dance until things make sense again; we dance until the haze of the club is replaced by a clarity of regret.
      </p>
      <p>
I open my eyes under an array of laser light and let my head spin. My arms punch to the snap of a grated drum. Every spin of my head, every lyric shouted to a friend is another question answered. Every glimpse of my brother and his fiance twirling in the crowd gives me direction.
      </p>
      <p>
	 Oddly enough, in this moment of twirling, the swirling stopped.
